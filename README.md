# clboy

A gameboy emulator written in common lisp. Using this as a tool to learn common lisp and learn more about emulation.

After completing the rust based space invader emulator I was inspired by kingcons to build a gameboy emulator in common lisp. I watched a bit of kingcons building a nes emulator in common lisp and I've been developing an interest in the language.

I built something fully functional in a few months. Had full support for Gameboy and moved onto Color Gameboy support and took a year to get that working. Pretty happy with what I built.
